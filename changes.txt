1) replaced the shape examples in demo to stop overlapping the text

2) added comments by the draw_rect function to clarify the third argument is a dimension tuple and not a point, also corrected this in the function itself (p1->p, p2->dim)

3) removed the automaticaly generated keycodes, as they weren't accurate

4) also removed the part for the keycodes that converted = to + when shift was held as it never removed the + and was obsolete by change 3
